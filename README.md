hosting page from http://fengweizhang.blogspot.com.ng/2012/04/convert-binary-shell-code-to-javascript.html

I was looking for how to convert a raw/bin shellcode to javascript encoded format. Noticed msfconsole has it where you can create it, 
but using msfvenom (js_le & ls_be) creates an unreadable format, so either use msfconsole to create the javascript %u encoded format

OR 

Get the raw/bin format paste on the hosted bintojavascript webpage and get the javacript encoded version.

this is just a quick dirty way to do this, especially if you want to port a from the scrath shellcode to javascript encoded format
